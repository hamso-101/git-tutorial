1)GIT -version control system recording changes made overtime in a database called repository.

2)Installation on ubuntu - $ sudo apt-get install git

3)Configuring git – first thing is to configure user-name and email in git to document changes made by user when recording commits (i.e) $ git config --global user.email"hamisi@gmail.com"
$ git config --global user.name "hamisi"

4)To verify your username and email input - $ git config -l

5)Setting up git project we use this command - $ git init projectname (i.e) this generates a new working directory using the assigned project name

6)Making the new created project folder my current working directory : $ cd projectname

7)Use the touch command to create an empty file which will use to create a simple hello world program (i.e) $ touch helloworld.c

8)Adding files in the directory we use the command :$ git add . this process is known as staging.this add period command adds the entire directory recursively.

9)Creating a commit. It is created to perform a permanent historical record of exactly how project files exist at the given time using -m (i.e) - $ git commit -m "first commit of project, just an empty file"
mv combined.txt dir1

10)After updating the project further perform git add and git commit (i.e) $ git add helloworld.c & $ git commit -m "added source code to helloworld.c"

11)read logs - having more commits in the project becomes useful to have historical record of the changes in our project over time, hence enter $ git log in the terminal to see an overview of the history so far

12)commit - contains id, message, time/date, author and a complete snapshot of the project. The whole point of commiting is to record checkpoints as we go.

13)echo - this is a standard unix command for writing content to a file (e.g) echo hello > file1.txt and hence the file1.txt is said to be modified

14)git status - this is run to see the status of the working directory and the staging area in the project

15)Every time you modify code you have to stage and the process of staging is to use the git add command

16)Always stage your code before commiting to the repository

17) git rm - removing a file from both working directory and the staging area (e.g) git rm file2.txt

18)mv command - can be used to move or renaming files in directory (e.g)mv file1.txt main.js & 
mv main.js file1.js , this renames file1.txt to file1.js
